# CFD_Assignment_AE4202

This README describes the main scripts and data-files present in this repository. 

This repository was created to document our work on the assignment from AE4202 "Computational Fluid Dynamics" course at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering of TU Delft. The goal of the assignment as well as its objectives is specified in "Assignment_Nov2022.pdf".

Folder "Mesh" contains 3 different meshes used for the purposes of the assignment. These are two meshes for the wing located at h/c = 3.36 from the ground: the coarse mesh containing approximately 20000 cells and the fine mesh containing approximately 80000 cells. Furthermore, there is one mesh for the case of wing located at h/c = 0.134 from the ground: a fine mesh containing approximately 60000 cells.

The remaining files contain setup conditions to run the openFOAM simulation for different scenarios. The names of the files suggest to which simulation scenario they refer to.
